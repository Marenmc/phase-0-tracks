## WHAT I AM TRYING...
1) First, need an overview of JQuery in a video.
2) Next, find some sort of cheat sheet
3) Find an exercise that will allow me to try it and see what's possible
4) Actually try to create a small website with 1-2 jQuery effects

## REFLECTIONS
Generally, I think this worked. I think I could have set a loftier goal than my tiny site. But generally I feel good about the way I timeboxed myself. ;)

## NOTES
What is JQuery?
A Javascript library, a collection of tools and methods that allows us to take shortcuts. It also allows for document traversing, event handling, and HTML writing and AJAX

JQuery has hover over effects, carousel gismo can load in new items. You can load a page by sliding across the page, etc.

Elements can load into the page as you scroll. And you can refresh without reloading the page.

Lots of plugins
Pretty easy to learn - the selectors are the same as CSS

Installing JQuery:
Just use the URL or the file path within the html document you're creating
