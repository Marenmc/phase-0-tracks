What are some key design philosophies of a Linux operating system?
- In Linux there is no UI, it's all in the console. That's why it's important to know how to navigate a machine with console.
- The assumption in Linux is that the user is tech literate, knows how to navigate their machine,and generally knows how the internet works.

What is a Virtual Private Server (VPS)?
- A VPS is a private machine or memory store that's not stored locally. A VPS could be located in New York, Utah, Dubai, etc.
- Using a remote server allows for additional memory to be used to run the server.
- In order to create and use a VPS, you have to remote into that server and set it up as if it is a local server (setting up Github, etc.)

Why is it bad to run a program as a root user on a Linux operating system?
- It is bad practice to run a program on a Linux operating system as a root user because of security concerns.If you are logged in as root, that means that all of the programs are running with root privledges, which can jeopardize the security of the server.
